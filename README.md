# osm-static-maps

This is a sample check

This pretends to be inspired in Google(c) static map service. But made using open source technologies.

You can find osm-static-maps [running in heroku](http://osm-static-maps.herokuapp.com/ "Fabulous!")

Here you have a [demo](http://osm-static-maps.herokuapp.com/?geojson=[{"type":"Feature","properties":{"party":"Republican"},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-104.05,48.99],[-97.22,48.98],[-96.58,45.94],[-104.03,45.94],[-104.05,48.99]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"party":"Democrat"},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.05,41.00],[-102.06,40.99],[-102.03,36.99],[-109.04,36.99],[-109.05,41.00]]]}}]&height=300&width=300 "Just what I wanted!")

And a [dynamic version](http://osm-static-maps.herokuapp.com/dynamic?geojson=[{"type":"Feature","properties":{"party":"Republican"},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-104.05,48.99],[-97.22,48.98],[-96.58,45.94],[-104.03,45.94],[-104.05,48.99]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"party":"Democrat"},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.05,41.00],[-102.06,40.99],[-102.03,36.99],[-109.04,36.99],[-109.05,41.00]]]}}]&height=300&width=300 "Wow it gets even better!!") of the demo, for testing purposes.

As a first approach, the service can render a geoJSON in a map, returning a PNG and you can determine also an optional height and width in pixels.

Parameters that can be used (can be passed to the app server as GET query params, or POST json body (remember to set the header `Content-Type: application/json`))

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| geojson | geojson object to be rendered in the map | `undefined` |
| height | height in pixels of the returned img | `600` |
| width | height in pixels of the returned img | `800` |
| center | center of the map lon,lat floats string | (center of the geojson) or `'-57.9524339,-34.921779'` |
| zoom | zoomlevel of the leaflet map | if `vectorserverUrl` available, use `12` else `20` |
| maxZoom | max zoomlevel of the leaflet map | `17` |
| attribution | attribution legend | `'osm-static-maps / Â© OpenStreetMap contributors'` |
| tileserverUrl | url of a tileserver | `'http://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'` |
| vectorserverUrl | url of a vector tile server (MVT style.json) | `undefined` |
| vectorserverToken | token of the vector tile server (MVT) | `'no-token'` |
| renderToHtml | returns html of the webpage containing the map (instead of a binary image) | `false` |
| type | format of the image returned (`'jpeg'`/`'png'`) | `'png'` |
| quality | quality of the image returned (`0`-`100`, only for `jpg`) | `100` |
| imagemin | enable lossless compression with [optipng](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin-optipng) / [jpegtran](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin-jpegtran) | `false` |
| oxipng | enable losslsess compression with [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng) | `false` |
| arrows | render arrows to show the direction of linestrings | `false` |

## How to use

1. This library is published in npm you can use it as an npm module

  ```
  -shell-
  npm install osm-static-maps

  -index.js-
  osmsm = require('osm-static-maps');
  osmsm({geojson: geojson})
    .then(function(imageBinaryBuffer) { ... })
    .catch(function(error) { ... })
  ```

2. alternatively you can download the code, run the sample server and use it standalone (see How to run)

3. lastly you can use the heroku-hosted alternative directly [here](http://osm-static-maps.herokuapp.com/ "Awesome!")

## How to run

nodejs is a prerequisite, please install it before this from here https://nodejs.org/
```
git clone git@github.com:jperelli/osm-static-maps.git
cd osm-static-maps
npm install
npm start
```

To develop with autoreload you can run directly if you have the required node version installed on the system

```
npm install && npm run dev
```

Or you can use docker-compose
```
docker-compose up
```
